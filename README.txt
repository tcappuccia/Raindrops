-Create a score variable
-Make an array of raindrops
-Create the catcher
-The catcher should follow the mosue
-A raindrop will fall
-The raindrop should be checked when it touches the catcher.
-If the raindrop touches the catcher and is "caught" then it disappears, the score increases, and more raindrops will fall.
-If the raindrop does not touch the catcher then it passes the edge of the screen and no points are added to the score. More raindrops will follow.
-After certain intervals more raindrops will fall.
-The process will repeat with the score increasing after every ranidrop that is caught.
