Raindrops Game
==============

-Create a score variable 
-Make an array of raindrops 
-Create the catcher 
-The catcher should be an object in the shape of a basket. 
-The catcher should follow the mouse -A raindrop will fall 
-The raindrop should be checked when it touches the catcher. 
-If the raindrop touches the catcher and is "caught" then it disappears 
-The score increases -More raindrops will fall. 
-If the raindrop does not touch the catcher then it passes the edge of the screen and no points are added to the score. 
-More raindrops will follow. 
-The process will repeat with the score increasing after every ranidrop that is caught.



Glitches
========
-The only present glitches that I have found are as follows:
    -if you score in between a 10 and 15, the warning sign that states that the game will intensify remains even on the game over screen.
    -Occasionally as the game gets more intense and the raindrops fall faster, a couple may fall at the same time.
    
Other than that, happy gaming! :)
