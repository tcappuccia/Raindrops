Raindrops
=========

-Create a score variable
-Make an array of raindrops
-Create the catcher
-The catcher should be an object in the shape of a basket.
-The catcher should follow the mouse
-A raindrop will fall
-The raindrop should be checked when it touches the catcher.
-If the raindrop touches the catcher and is "caught" then it disappears
-The score increases
-More raindrops will fall.
-If the raindrop does not touch the catcher then it passes the edge of the screen and no points are added to the score. 
-More raindrops will follow.
-The process will repeat with the score increasing after every ranidrop that is caught.


Raindrop Game Infomation
========================
-You have thirty seconds to catch as many raindrops as you can.
-You also have three lives in case if you drop any of the raindrops.
-The raindrops increase in speed as the score increases.
-Other than that, have fun and good luck!


Glitches
========
-The only glitches that I noticed were that occasionally a couple raindrops fall at the same time and if you score between a 10 and 15 the text that says "Warning: Game is about to intensify!" remains even on the gameOver screen.
